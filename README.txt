Team Unlimited Bananas: William Smith (wmsmith@wpi.edu) & Abraham Goodman (abgoodman1@wpi.edu)

Platform: Windows
Files: Game files are Fish, ViewCaught, Lure, Reticle, and GameStart (both .h and .cpp for each), and game.cpp
Code structure: Normal
How to compile: Load the solution into Visual Studio 2022 and build.
Additional notes: The game starts off with a guaranteed 3 easy fish, and then starts randomly selecting harder fish. There is no win condition, as this is intended to be a relaxing endless fishing game.
